# Land of Desire

**Land of Desire** is a free and open-source 3D sex simulator, inspired by games such as *3D Sex Villa* and *Honey Select*. Built using **UPBGE 0.36.1**, the goal of this project is to provide a moddable and fully accessible alternative within the adult game genre.

This project aims to be both a finished product and a **blueprint** for other developers who wish to create similar games. All assets included are either in the **public domain** or licensed under **CC0**.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

The game includes simple but useful documentation in the game files ('Documentation English.pdf' or 'Documentacion EspaÃ±ol.pdf') to help you understand the structure of its systems. Whether you're looking to tweak existing content or build something new, it should serve as a helpful guide for getting started.

> **Note:** If you plan to modify the game â€” whether it's by adding clothes, animations, or other assets â€” it is **strongly recommended** to use **UPBGE version 0.36.1** to avoid compatibility issues.
